<center><p><h1>Best DJI Osmo Pocket Accessories</h1></p></center>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><img src="as.png">-
<p>The DJI Osmo Pocket is one of my favourite products that’s come along in recent times. I loved the GoPro</p>
<p>Karma Grip combined with the GoPro Hero6 Black, but the DJI Osmo Pocket takes things to another level. Part</p>
<p>of the reason behind that is the Osmo Pocket’s small size. You can slip it in your pocket ready to whip out and</p>
<p>be shooting within seconds. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Quality-wise the footage is up there with the best action cameras, if not better in some instances.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Another great thing about the DJI Osmo Pocket is that it’s easy to use. However, there are a few accessories</p>
<p>that can help you get a bit more from it. For example, you might want an external mic, a case or a tripod</p>
<p>mount. Here’s my pick of the best DJI Osmo Pocket accessories:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><img src="ash.png">-
<p><h1>1. DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel</h1></p>
<p>If I could only buy one accessory for the DJI Osmo Pocket it would be the DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel. It</p>
<p>makes it far easier to pan the Osmo Pocket’s gimbal smoothly. What’s more, it has a switch so you can flick</p>
<p>quickly between using the wheel to pan horizontally or vertically. </p>
<br>
<p>Attaching the Controller Wheel means you can’t connect your phone, but with better control over the gimbal,</p>
<p>there’s far less need to do that.</p>
<br>
<p>Buy the DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel on eBay for £6. Also available from Amazon (£10), Scan Computers</P>
<p>(£52), Wex Photographic (£53), Park Cameras (£53).</p>
<br>
<p>The DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel is available for £53 from Wex Photo Video or $59 from Adorama,

<h2>2. DJI Osmo Pocket Expansion Kit</h2>
<p>The DJI Osmo Pocket Expansion Kit includes four items that can all be bought separately, but buying them <br>together is cheaper. The kit is made up of the DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel, Wireless Module,  Accessory Mount Adapter and a 32GB Samsung microSD card. <br><br>

Of those items, the DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel is the most useful (unless you don’t already have a microSD card). <br><br>

<p>If you want to shoot time-lapses or vlogs, the Wireless Module is another great addition. It’s basically a small<br> docking station with wireless connectivity for the Osmo Pocket. Around the back, there’s a USB-C connection that slots into the Pocket’s USB-C port. <br><br></P>

The Module’s Wi-Fi system allows you to wirelessly connect the Osmo Pocket to a smartphone running the DJI Mimo app. Once the connection is made, you can control the Pocket remotely with the usual Mimo controls. You can even transfer video and stills wirelessly.<br><br>

You can buy the DJI Osmo Pocket Controller Wheel for £53 from Wex Photo Video or $59 from Adorama. Meanwhile, the Wireless Module retails for £53 and $59 at the same outlets. However, Wex sells the Osmo Pocket Expansion kit for £99. and Adorama sells it for $109, making the Expansion Kit’s value very clear if you want a couple of the components.

<h1>3. PolarPro Minimalist Case</h1>
<p>The Osmo Pocket comes with a neat little case, but it can’t hold all the components of the Expansion Kit. That’s<br> where the PolarPro Minimalist Case comes in. This semi-rigid case opens like a clamshell to reveal the foam-filled interior that’s perfectly shaped to house everything you need.<br><br></p>

<p>Helpfully, the Osmo Pocket space is shaped to accommodate the camera with the Controller Wheel attached. That means it’s ready to roll with a press of the power button.<br><br></p>

<p>There are also slots to hold both of the supplied smartphone connectors. In addition, the zip-close mesh pocket can hold a set of PolarPro’s ND filters for the Osmo Pocket, the charging cable and the DJI Osmo Pocket Mic Adapter.<br><br></p>

The combination of the customised foam, mesh pocket and the rigid exterior make this the best case for the DJI Osmo Pocket.

<p>The PolarPro Minimalist Case is available from Amazon UK for £22.98 and Amazon US for $25.21.</p>
